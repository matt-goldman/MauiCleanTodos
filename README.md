# MauiCleanTodos

**Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core, .NET MAUI and Blazor**

A full stack cloud, web, mobile and desktop solution built with .NET.

* ASP.NET Core web API built in [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture)
* SPA built in Blazor (WIP)
* Mobile and desktop app built with .NET MAUI

## Code Sharing

The primary purpose of this solution is to demonstrate the benefits of code sharing within a full-stack .NET solution. DTOs are shared between the API and UI projects, and API interaction logic is shared between the two UI projects.    
    
In addition to showing the benefits of sharing code, it shows some of the traps of overengineering you can easily call into. This over-engineered approach is shown on the `main` branch. A better approach is shown on the `add-blazor` branch.

This wil provide more insight into the approaches taken on the two branches.
